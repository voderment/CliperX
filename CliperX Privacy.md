Privacy Policy for CliperX

Last updated:2026.01.28

CliperX is a clipboard manager. We take privacy seriously and design the app to keep your data on your device.

Information We Collect

Clipboard content: When enabled, CliperX reads your system clipboard to build a history. This may include text, URLs, images, and file references.
App settings: Preferences such as history limits, retention days, and UI options.
Maximum Saved Items: Sets the maximum number of history items stored; when the limit is reached, the oldest items are removed.
Retention Duration: Controls how long items are kept; items older than the selected duration are removed (Forever keeps items until you delete them or hit the maximum).
No account data: CliperX does not require an account or collect personal profile information.
How We Use Your Information

To show clipboard history and allow quick search, preview, and paste.
To restore your history and settings between launches.
Where Your Data Is Stored

Local storage only: Clipboard history and previews are stored locally on your device (in Application Support).
No cloud sync (currently): We do not upload your clipboard history to any server. iCloud sync is not available at this time.
Network Access

Favicon preview: When you copy a URL, CliperX may fetch the website’s favicon to display a preview icon. This can contact the target site or Google’s favicon service (www.google.com/s2/favicons). This request may include the URL or domain to retrieve the icon.
No analytics or tracking: We do not use analytics, ads, or tracking SDKs.
Accessibility Permission

CliperX uses macOS Accessibility permission only for the optional “auto paste to active app” feature (pasting the copied item into the currently focused app). CliperX does not read screen contents, control other apps beyond issuing the paste command, or access any data beyond the user’s clipboard.
Data Sharing

We do not sell or share your clipboard data with third parties.
The only external requests are for favicon images, as described above.
Data Retention

Clipboard history is retained according to your settings (history limit and retention days). You can clear history at any time from within the app.
Your Choices

You can disable clipboard history, adjust retention settings, or clear stored items at any time.
You can disable URL previews if you do not want external favicon requests. (If this option is not currently exposed, we can add it.)
Security

We store data locally on your device. We do not transmit clipboard contents to any server.
